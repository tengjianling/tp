**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add q/QUESTION`, `QUESTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add q/What is the heart responsible for?`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `q/QUESTION [t/TAG]` can be used as `q/What is the heart responsible for? t/cardiology` or as `q/What is the heart responsible for?`

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/heart`, `t/heart t/cardiology` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`, `a/ANSWER q/QUESTION` is also acceptable.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:bulb: Tip:**<br>

You can remove all the QAndA's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

</div>

How it should look in the application:

Entering the edit command:

The `edit 6 q/how many bones are there in an ADULT human skeleton? t/ ` input will edit the QAndA at index 6 and remove all tags as shown.

### Finding QAndA by keywords: `find` (by: Yong Ming Yang)
The `find` function allows you to find existing QAndA based on keywords and phrases.

If you would like to search the database based on keywords or phrases, you can do so in a few ways by following the respective formats:

1. Find QAndA with **questions** containing any of the given keywords.

    Format: `find q/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `find q/PHRASE 1, KEYWORD1`

2. Find QAndA with **answers** containing any of the given keywords.

    Format: `find a/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `find q/PHRASE 1, KEYWORD1`

3. Find QAndA with **tags** containing any of the given keywords.
    Keywords for tags can also have phrases, however this requires the text to have an exact match (case-insensitive).

    Format: `find t/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `find q/PHRASE1, KEYWORD1`

4. Find QAndA with **questions or answers** containing any of the given keywords.

    Format: `find KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `find PHRASE, KEYWORD1`

Examples:
* `find q/system, disease` - finds questions containing the word "system" and/or "disease".
* `find a/vessels, chronic disease` - finds answers containing the word vessels, and/or the phrase "chronic disease".
* `find t/anatomy, Nervous System` - finds QAndAs tagged with the word "anatomy" and/or "Nervous System" (can be both), requires exact match of words (case-insensitive).
* `find infection, nervous system` - finds question and/or answers containing the word "infection", and/or the phrase "nervous system"

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:bulb: Tip:**<br>
`PHRASE` refers to words with spaces in between, for example: "nervous system"

</div>

How it should look like in the application:

![FindContext](images/FindContext.PNG)

Expected Result:

![FindResult](images/FindResult.PNG)

The input `find t/respiratory system, disease` will return the questions with the tag "respiratory system" and/or "disease" as shown.

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

If you want to reset your question book, this command clears all existing entries.

Format: `clear`

### Starting a quiz: `quiz` (by: Joshua Tan)

You will be able to test yourself on your knowledge from the questions that you added into the application.
Medmoriser will randomly select a question to quiz you based on the keywords you provide.

There are 2 ways that you can quiz yourself. By question keywords or by tag keywords. If multiple keywords are given, you will be quizzed on a question that has any of the keywords, or all of the keywords.

1. Quiz a QAndA with **questions** containing any of the given keywords.

    Format: `quiz q/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `quiz q/PHRASE 1, KEYWORD 1`

2. Quiz a QAndA wih **tag** containing any of the given keywords.

    Format: `quiz t/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `quiz t/PHRASE 1, KEYWORD 1`

Examples:
* `quiz q/immunology` - randomly quizzes a question containing the word "immunology".
* `quiz t/surgery, injuries` - randomly quizzes a question that was tagged with the word "surgery" and/or "injuries" (can be both), requires exact match of words (case-insensitive).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:bulb: Tip:**<br>
To run other commands other than `next` or `answer`, you have to first `endquiz`.

</div>

How it should look like in the application:

![QuizContext](images/QuizContext.png)

Expected Result:

![QuizResult](images/QuizResult.png)

### Answering a quiz question: `answer` (by: Joshua Tan)
You will be able to key in your answer for a quiz question. After your answer is submitted, Medmoriser will flash the correct answer to the question and you will be able to check your answer:

Format: `answer YOUR_ANSWER`

Example:
* `answer This is my answer to the quiz question`

### Moving to next quiz question: `next` (by: Teng Jian Ling)
You will be able to continue testing yourself without ending the current quiz. Medmoriser will randomly select a different quiz question based on the same keywords you provided previously.

Format: `next`

Example:
* `next` - will show you the next question in this quiz

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:bulb: Tip:**<br>
If you want to skip the current quiz question, you can enter `next` without answering first.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the edit command:**<br>

* You can only use the `next` command when you are in an ongoing quiz.
* When there are no more questions with the specified keywords, you will not be able to use `next` to retrieve another quiz question.

</div>

How it should look like in the application:

![QuizContext](images/NextContext.png)

Expected Result:

![QuizResult](images/NextResult.png)

Assuming the user is in a quiz for `t/respiratory system`, the input `next` will display a new randomly selected question with the tag `respiratory system`, as shown above. 

### Ending a quiz: `endquiz` (by: Joshua Tan)
Once you are done with a quiz and have finished comparing your input answer with the answer in the question, you have to end the quiz to run other commands.
If you want to run other commands in the midst of a quiz(ie. if you have not answered the question) you have to end the quiz first:

Format: `endquiz`

### Exiting the program: `exit`

If you're done with your work, this command allows you to exit the program. You can also exit the application by closing its window like any normal program window.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

You don't need to worry about saving data manually, as Medmoriser data is automatically saved in the hard disk after any command that changes the data.

### Archiving data files [Coming Soon]

If you don't need certain questions anymore, you can archive them to declutter your workspace.
